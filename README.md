# password-verification
Verifying a stream of passwords.
Read a series of passwords from an input file. Remove any leading or trailing blanks. For each password, determine if it is valid by calling a method to test for criteria. The main method should print each password, and a message that it is valid or not valid. Your software requires that users’ passwords meet the following requirements:
•	The password should be at least 8 characters
•	The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter
•	The password should contain at least one digit
•	The password may not contain a blank
